b) https://english.api.rakuten.net/LemmoTresto/api/joke3/details is the API THAT WAS USED.
c) Get host adn key from the api and insert the things below into your env file. 

        rapidapihost= enter the api host here 
        rapidapikey= enter the api key here

The other API used was
https://funtranslations.com/api/ 
However, there is no key or individual aspect that you need to sign up for. 


Heroku: 
Make account at heroku.com
a) login: heroku login -i

c) heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
d) heroku pg:wait
e) psql
f) ALTER DATASE [postgres(database being used)] OWNER TO [uesrname^^ used in step 4];
g)\l you should see that the name of the database is next to the owner that you just entered. 
h)\q to exit form psql
i) PGUSER=[username] heroku pg:push postgres DATABASE_URL
j) heroku pg:psql to connect to heroku server data base.
k) create requirments.txt and populate it
l) create Procfile and enter web: python app.py
m) Enter the key and host from your env file into your heroku app via the app settings page under config vars

GENERAL ISSUES: always make sure your database is running: sudo service postgresql start
if you have trouble downloading things enter sudo infront of the command

Known Issues:

One of the biggest issues that I am having is displaying the database information aka chat with react, but I figured out a work around explained in the first technical issue. I think it would be better to be send the information without having to concat them originally, so I bet I will have to solve this issue for milestone two. If I had more time I would have like to figure that out more because my app works, but it creates multiple spots that I have to parse through code which makes it even more inefficient. It is in the Chatbox react file along with the app py emit_all_messages functions that concat it. 


Technical ISSUES.

I was having a really hard time with using react to accept the information and then add it to the use case. I know that I could have fixed it better than the way that I did, but the main issue was the SQL calls that I was doing. I have the information stored in the database in two colums. I could probably switch that up differently and it should work better. But I was passing all the information as one and it would just add the last item along with the rest. So instead I used the example from class and concatinated the information before I sent it over to react from python. And I changed the style with a function that gets the first few letters of the string and if its bot: then the style would change. This is not ideal, and if someone makes their user name bot: or bot:[anything] it would be the same style as the bot. 

Another Technical issue I was having was dealing with css and having the screen be completely full even if there is not enough information. I went on w3 schools and found out that you can use vh and vw which represent the size of the screen. For example 90vh would be 90% of the screen size vertically and same idea with width. 

Lastly, I had a techincal issue when I was setting up the database to then push it to heroku. The issue that I was having was that when I went into the pg_hba.conf file and I noticed the one on my base machine was actually wrong. It was peer instead of md-5. I was not sure why that was the case, and I thought I changed it duing the class period but I slowed down and redid all the steps and found that I was missing information on that step.
